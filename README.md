Installation
-------------

Symlink the script to a location visible by `PATH`. I have mine set to `~/bin`.

An optional global variable `GIT_CACHED_DIR` can be set. This is where the cached objects are stored. The default is shown below.

```bash
export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH
export GIT_CACHED_DIR=$HOME/.git_objects
```

Usage
------

`gitc` accepts all `git` commands. For the ones it does not know of, it will simply pass-through to git.

```bash
gitc clone --branch 8.x git://git.drupal.org/project/drupal.git
```

If at anytime you need to remove all reference to the cache (runs `git repack -a -d -l` and removes pointer in the alternates file.:

```bash
gitc cache-detach
```

It can be added back at any time (runs `git gc` garbage collection to remove local objects):

```bash
gitc cache-attach
```

To repair it (it simply detaches and reattaches):

```bash
gitc cache-repair
```

If you need to run git commands on the cache store itself, use the `cache` sub-command:

```bash
gitc cache remote
```

Notes
------

  - The cached clone is set with `--reference` pointing to the object storage. See the man page for git-clone.
  - If you move the clone to another machine it may invalidate the path pointing to the object store. Changing `GIT_CACHE_DIR` will do the same. Simply call `gitc cache-repair` in your working directory to fix it.
  - This is the first bash script Iâ€™ve created. Consider this a fair warning. Tested on Mac OSX Lion.
  - This new development version is incompatible with master.
